# **Census Data Products**


The US Census Bureau ([www.census.gov](www.census.gov)) conducts 130+ surveys each year.

**[data.census.gov](data.census.gov)** is the primary Census Bureau data portal (formerly FactFinder).

Many surveys are conducted on behalf of other federal agencies with their own data portals and/or APIs e.g. 

- Bureau of Labor Statistics [www.bls.gov/developers/](www.bls.gov/developers/)

- Bureau of Economic Analysis [apps.bea.gov/API/signup/index.cfm](https://apps.bea.gov/API/signup/index.cfm)

- National Center for Health Statistics
 [www.cdc.gov/nchs/index.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/index.htm)

- National Center for Education Statistics [nces.ed.gov/datatools/](https://nces.ed.gov/datatools/)

### *Decennial Census*

www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/data.html

The decennial census is the foundation of all official demographic data in the U.S.

It is mandated in the U.S. Constitution under Article 1, Section 2

The very first thing the Constitution directs the new government to do is *Go Gather Data*

For most data users, the decennial census has limited *direct* usability because it is updated only once a decade and because it contains only a few variables i.e.

- Population by Age/Sex/Race/Ethnicity 

- Relationship to Head of Household

- Housing Tenure (Own, Mortgage, or Rent) 
	
Statutory use cases:

- Congressional Apportionment
	
- Redistricting – P.L.94-171 data

Census Geography covered in more detail below


### *American Community Survey*

www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs

The ACS is a sample survey of approximately two million U.S. households each year (~1.6%)

Began in 2005 replacing the census long form

1-year ACS data is available for Counties and Places with population > 65,000

5-year ACS data is available for all Counties and Places

ACS Questions/Variables:	

~50 questions for each person at the residence
	
~24 questions on the housing unit

Comparison of ACS Data Tables and Profiles: 	https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/data-tables.html

**Narrative Profiles** - Summaries of information in the Data Profiles using nontechnical text

https://www.census.gov/acs/www/data/data-tables-and-tools/narrative-profiles/

Includes Education and Income data but not cross-tabulated.

**Data Profiles (DP)** - provide broad social, economic, housing and demographic information in a total of four profiles

	Selected Social Characteristics – DP02
		Educational Attainment, Languages spoken, Disability status
		
	Selected Economic Characteristics – DP03
		Income and Earning, Poverty Status, Health Insurance Coverage, Commuting
		
	Selected Housing Characteristics – DP04
		Own/Rent, Persons per Household, Broadband Access, Heating Fuel Type
		
	Demographic and Housing Estimates – DP05
		Age/Sex, Race, Ethnicity, Group Quarters Populations, CVAP
	
**Comparison Profiles (CP)** - Time series of ACS data found in Data Profiles


ACS smallest geography - Block Group

### *Population Estimates and Projections*

#### Estimates
[www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest.html](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest.html
)

Annually updated population estimates by Age/Sex/Race/Ethnicity


Population Estimates = Census + Births - Deaths + Net Migration


Key uses:

- Federal funding distribution

- Survey control totals

Estimates smallest geography = County and Place

#### Projections

Biennual population projections by Age/Sex/Race/Ethnicity

Based on current trends in fertility, mortality and net international migration

www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popproj.html



Projections smallest geography = Nation

### *Planning Database*

Select demographic and socio-economic variables from ACS + operational metrics such as response rates

Convenient for downloading and locally storing data for recurring analysis (but APIs are more convenient)

Planning database smallest geography = Block Group

### *Census Microdata API*

Allows for custom tabulations based on a sample of responses

All other census datasets and APIs are aggregated data i.e. summaries and cross-tabulations 

Census microdata smallest geography = Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMA) - at least 100,000 people contained in one state

### *Health Insurance Statistics*

From various sample surveys

- American Community Survey (ACS)

- Current Population Survey (CPS)

CPS smallest geography = State

- Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP)

SIPP is one of the only longitudinal studies – same respondents for up to four years

SIPP smallest geography = Region 

### *Small Area Health Insurance Estimates (SAHIE)*

2006-2017 only

Modeling that combines survey data with administrative records

SAHIE smallest geography = County

### *Poverty Statistics*

Drawn from various sample surveys:

- American Community Survey (ACS)

- Current Population Survey (CPS)

- Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE)

Official vs Supplemental Poverty Measures:

www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2021/09/difference-between-supplemental-and-official-poverty-measures.html

### *International Database*

Demographic data for over 200 countries since 1960

## **Economic Data APIs**

### *Economic Census*
The Economic Census is the most comprehensive measure of the U.S. economy. 

Data is gathered every five years in years ending in 2 and 7.

Data include:

- Establishments

- Employees

- Payroll

- Sales and Receipts 


Economic Census smallest geography = County

### *Economic Sample Surveys and Other Programs*

- Annual Business Survey

- Annual Survey of Manufactures

- Annual Survey of Entrepreneurs

- Survey of Business Owners

- Economic Indicators

- International Trade Program

- Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD)

Great Resource at UNM: Bureau of Business and Economic Research bber.unm.edu

BBER are experts in all census data including economic data and particularly for NM 

## **Public Sector Statistics – Government of Surveys**

New Mexico e.g.

- 138 general purpose governments (33 counties + 105 municipal)

- 875 special purpose governments such as School Districts, Water Authorities, Acequias, etc. 

## IPUMS - Integrated Public Use Microdata Series

Great alternative source of census data housed at the University of Minnesota

World's largest population database

## Census Hierarchy

https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/reference/geodiagram.pdf

Census Bureau provides data in both political geographies (e.g. States, Counties, Cities) and Statistical geography (e.g. Regions, Tracts, Block Groups)

Geographies evolve through annexations, incorporations, redistricting, decennial updates, etc. Beware when doing time series analysis 

## TigerWeb

https://tigerweb.geo.census.gov/tigerweb/

## Shapefiles and Geodatabases

Census geography files can be downloaded for use in any local GIS. Geospatial files can be joined with census or other data for analysis and map display via FIPS codes.  

Shapefiles: https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html

Geodatabases:https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-geodatabase-file.html

## Geocoding 

Identifying x, y coordinates from addresses (or addresses from x,y coordinates)

Census geocoding service – https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/

### Alternative geocoding services:

https://geoservices.tamu.edu/Services/Geocode/OtherGeocoders/	

https://www.geocod.io/compare/

## Census TIGERweb GeoServices REST API

https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/TIGERweb-map-service.html

The GeoServices REST Specification provides an open way for web clients to communicate with GIS servers. Clients issue HTTP requests to the server through structured URLs to integrate interactive maps. 

## Zip Codes and ZCTAS
Doing spatial analysis with Zip Codes can be problematic, and many researchers avoid Zip Codes when possible. 

Some Zip Codes are non-contiguous and can cross state boundaries or cross census block boundaries.

See zip code 81137 in CO and NM. 

This is largely because the United States Postal Service is concerned with routes, not polygons. 


 

Nonetheless, some datasets you wish to analyze may only be available at the Zip Code level. 

The Census Bureau has created Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) which essentially create polygons that encapsulate postal routes.
